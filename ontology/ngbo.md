description: 'The Next Generation Biobanking Ontology (NGBO) is an open application ontology representing contextual data about omics digital assets in biobank. The ontology focuses on capturing the information about three main activities: wet bench analysis used to generate omics data, bioinformatics analysis used to analyze and interpret data, and data management.'
domain: investigations
purpose: 'This ontology is developed to represent omics contextual data to support experts in specimen-derivative data  discovery and reuse stages.'
scope: 'This ontology includes real-world physical objects such as specimens, computerized objects such as datasets, and planned processes and related specifications'
intended users: 'The intended end-users are biobanking organizations, data collectors, omics researchers, and decision-makers.'
commitment to collaboration: 'new terms introduced by NGBO will be submitted to appropriate OBO foundry domain ontology when possible. NGBO also, accept and review requests from community to edit/add terms through issue requests here (https://github.com/Dalalghamdi/NGBO/issues)'
